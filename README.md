# Code exercises PBL 2025

  

  

## Methods

We have already gone through the main content of the Deep Learning (Bishop)  in our PBL reading group. As an exercise, I have prepared problems that cover some common methods appeared in the textbook.

  

The methods we aim to cover are as follows:

  

1. Single layer network: Logistic Regression

2. Simple Neural Network for classification

3. Continuous Latent variables: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

4. Discrete  Latent variables:  Gaussian Mixture Model using the EM Algorithm

  
  
  

## Homework

I have already prepared 4 code exercises for the methods listed above.

You can access the codes either through: https://github.com/yuzhe-li/PBL2025_exercise


### Your task

Your task is to complete the incomplete code to solve a classification, PCA, or clustering problem using the provided data.

  

### Requirement

To earn credit for the PBL course, you need to choose at least two of the exercises to complete as your homework.

And of course, you are welcome to attempt all the methods if you would like.

  
  

## How to use
